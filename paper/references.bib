	abstract = {One of the most wide-spreading diseases among women is Breast Cancer. For this reason, a proper diagnosis is necessary for designating necessary treatment. Using the previous information about patients, diagnosis is being performed by various machine learning algorithms. As the data are getting bigger, it is becoming more necessary to extract the useful information from the huge pile of information. In this paper, we have used the Wisconsin diagnostic breast cancer dataset (WDBC) and SEER 2017 Breast Cancer Dataset. Then we have used Principal component analysis in order to extract useful features. After that, we have classified the reduced datasets using multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and convolution neural network (CNN). Then we have provided a comparative comparison of our model for both the reduced datasets. Our MLP model has achieved an accuracy of 99.1\% on reduced WDBC dataset and 89.3\% on SEER 2017 Breast Cancer dataset whereas CNN Model has achieved 96.4\% on reduced WDBC dataset and 88.3 \% on SEER 2017 Breast Cancer Dataset.},

              In the era of omics-driven research, it remains a common dilemma to stratify individual patients based on the molecular characteristics of their tumors. To improve molecular stratification of patients with breast cancer, we developed the Gaussian mixture model (GMM)–based classifier. This probabilistic classifier was built on mRNA expression data from more than 300 clinical samples of breast cancer and healthy tissue and was validated on datasets of ESR1, PGR, and ERBB2, which encode standard clinical markers and therapeutic targets. To demonstrate how a GMM approach could be exploited for multiclass classification using data from a candidate marker, we analyzed the insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF1R), a promising target, but a marker of uncertain importance in breast cancer. The GMM defined subclasses with downregulated (40\%), unchanged (39\%), upregulated (19\%), and overexpressed (2\%) IGF1R levels; inter- and intrapatient analyses of IGF1R transcript and protein levels supported these predictions. Overexpressed IGF1R was observed in a small percentage of tumors. Samples with unchanged and upregulated IGF1R were differentiated tumors, and downregulation of IGF1R correlated with poorly differentiated, high-risk hormone receptor–negative and HER2-positive tumors. A similar correlation was found in the independent cohort of carcinoma in situ, suggesting that loss or low expression of IGF1R is a marker of aggressiveness in subsets of preinvasive and invasive breast cancer. These results demonstrate the importance of probabilistic modeling that delves deeper into molecular data and aims to improve diagnostic classification, prognostic assessment, and treatment selection.
            
            
              Significance:
              A GMM classifier demonstrates potential use for clinical validation of markers and determination of target populations, particularly when availability of specimens for marker development is low.},

Consequently, primary care improves disease prevention and death. Early detection increases treatment options and saves life, which is the major target of this research. This research indicates the versatility of the methodology by integrating contemporary segmentation approaches with machine learning methods, which are developing areas of research. In the pre-processing process, an adaptive median filter is utilized for noise removal, enhancement of image quality, conservation of edges, and smoothing. This research makes a significant contribution by proposing a new parameter for evaluating K-means and a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) performance. A hybrid combination of segmentation and detection was applied to breast cancer. The proposed technique is significant for classifying benign and malignant tumors. The simulated results are discussed and evaluated to determine the competence of this method for the early diagnosis of breast cancer. This method allows medical experts to recognize breast cancer at a faster rate and provide higher accuracy. An ANOVA test was used to determine the multi-variant analysis and prediction rate for the proposed method.},

	abstract = {Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of death among women. Early detection of breast cancer can signifi­ cantly improve the lives of millions of women across the globe. Given importance of finding solution/framework for early detection and diagnosis, recently many AI researchers are focusing to automate this task. The other reasons for surge in research activities in this direction are advent of robust AI algorithms (deep learning), availability of hardware that can run/train those robust and complex AI algorithms and accessibility of large enough dataset required for training AI algorithms. Different imaging modalities that have been exploited by researchers to automate the task of breast cancer detection are mammograms, ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging, histopathological images or any combination of them. This article analyzes these imaging modalities and presents their strengths and limitations. It also enlists resources from where their datasets can be accessed for research purpose. This article then summarizes AI and computer vision based state-of-the-art methods proposed in the last decade to detect breast cancer using various imaging modalities. Primarily, in this article we have focused on reviewing frameworks that have reported results using mammograms as it is the most widely used breast imaging modality that serves as the first test that medical practitioners usually prescribe for the detection of breast cancer. Another reason for focusing on mammogram imaging modalities is the availability of its labelled datasets. Datasets availability is one of the most important aspects for the development of AI based frameworks as such algorithms are data hungry and generally quality of dataset affects performance of AI based algorithms. In a nutshell, this research article will act as a primary resource for the research community working in the field of automated breast imaging analysis.},

	abstract = {Patients with breast cancer are prone to serious health-related complications with higher mortality. The primary reason might be a misinterpretation of radiologists in recognizing suspicious lesions due to technical issues in imaging qualities and heterogeneous breast densities which increases the false-(positive and negative) ratio. Early intervention is significant in establishing an up-to-date prognosis process which can successfully mitigate complications of disease with higher recovery. The manual screening of breast abnormalities through traditional machine learning schemes misinterpret the inconsistent feature-extraction process which poses a problem, i.e., patients being called-back for biopsies to eliminates the suspicions. However, several deep learning-based methods have been developed for reliable breast cancer prognosis and classification but very few of them provided a comprehensive overview of lesions segmentation. This research focusses on providing benefits and risks of breast multi-imaging modalities, segmentation schemes, feature extraction, classification of breast abnormalities through state-of-the-art deep learning approaches.

It needs a breast cancer prediction tool that can classify a breast tumor whether it was a harmful malignant tumor or un-harmful benign tumor. In this paper, two algorithms of machine learning, namely Support Vector Machine and Extreme Gradient Boosting technique will be compared for classification purpose. Prior to the classification, the number of data attribute will be reduced from the raw data by extracting features using Principal Component Analysis. A clustering method, namely K-Means is also used for dimensionality reduction besides the Principal Component Analysis. This paper will present a comparison among four models based on two dimensionality reduction methods combined with two classifiers which applied on Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset. The comparison will be measured by using accuracy, sensitivity and specificity metrics evaluated from the confusion matrices. The experimental results have indicated that the K-Means method, which is not usually used for dimensionality reduction can perform well compared to the popular Principal Component Analysis.},

Therefore, this paper proposes a new K–means++ clustering based on Cuckoo Search Optimization (KM++CSO) for breast cancer detection. The pre-processing method is used to improve the proposed KM++CSO method more segmentation efﬁciently. Furthermore, the interpretability is further enhanced using mathematical morphology and OTSU’s threshold. To this end, we tested the effectiveness of the KM++CSO methods on the mammogram image analysis society of the Mini–Mammographic Image Analysis Society (Mini–MIAS), the Digital Database for Screening Mammography (DDSM), and the Breast Cancer Digital Repository (BCDR) dataset through crossvalidation. We maximize the accuracy and Jaccard index score, which is a measure that indicates the similarity between detected cancer and their corresponding reference cancer regions. The experimental results showed that the detection method obtained an accuracy of 96.42\% (Mini–MIAS), 95.49\% (DDSM), and 96.92\% (BCDR). On overage, the KM++CSO method obtained 96.27\% accuracy for three publicly available datasets. In addition, the detection results provided the 91.05\% Jaccard index score.},

First, principal component analysis (PCA) was used to identify valuable parts of the data and further reduce the dimensions of the data. The cumulative proportion of the top five major components was 99.89\%. The multilayer perceptron network (MLP) method was then used to extract characteristics included in the data, and the structure of the network was designed for the exploration of how data developed as the dimensions increased or decreased. As such, the model was established to first explore (high dimensional) and then develop (low dimensional) data. After training and learning, the models could segregate the representative attributes and numbers, and the characteristic data were then used as classifiers through transfer learning techniques using support vector machines. To verify the proposed method, the experiment performed \$k\$ -fold cross-validation 50 times on average. Experimental results verified the proposed method with 10-fold cross-validation using the dataset of Manuel Gomes from the University Hospital Centre of Coimbra, and an accuracy of 86.97\% was achieved. The results indicate that the proposed series of processes and methods can effectively and powerfully examine the incidence of breast cancer. Furthermore, the data processed using only the PCA method as well as the characteristics extracted through the PCA method then combined with MLP after learning were analyzed. The differences displayed for the visual technique characteristics of the t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding were compared.},

	abstract = {Breast cancer is one of the most common cancer diseases in women. The rapid and accurate diagnosis of breast cancer is of great signiﬁcance for the treatment of cancer. Artiﬁcial intelligence and machine learning algorithms are used to identify breast malignant tumors, which can effectively solve the problems of insufﬁcient recognition accuracy and long time-consuming in traditional breast cancer diagnosis methods. To solve these problems, we proposed a method of attribute selection and feature extraction based on random forest (RF) combined with principal component analysis (PCA) for rapid and accurate diagnosis of breast cancer. Firstly, RF was used to reduce 30 attributes of breast cancer categorical data. According to the average importance of attributes and out of bag error, 21 relatively important attribute data were selected for feature extraction based on PCA. The seven features extracted from PCA were used to establish an extreme learning machine (ELM) classiﬁcation model with different activation functions. By comparing the classiﬁcation accuracy and training time of these different models, the activation function of the hidden layer was determined as the sigmoid function. When the number of neurons in the hidden layer was 27, the accuracy of the test set was 98.75\%, the accuracy of the training set was 99.06\%, and the training time was only 0.0022 s. Finally, in order to verify the superiority of this method in breast cancer diagnosis, we compared with the ELM model based on the original breast cancer data and other intelligent classiﬁcation algorithm models. The algorithm used in this article has a faster recognition time and a higher recognition accuracy than other algorithms. We also used the breast cancer data of breast tissue reactance features to verify the reliability of this method, and ideal results were obtained. The experimental results show that RF-PCA combined with ELM can signiﬁcantly reduce the time required for the diagnosis of breast cancer, which has the ability of rapid and accurate identiﬁcation of breast cancer and provides a theoretical basis for the intelligent diagnosis of breast cancer.},

	abstract = {Breast cancer is a leading cause of mortality in women. In Malaysia, it is the most common cancer to affect women. The most common form of breast cancer is inﬁltrating ductal carcinoma (IDC). A proteomic approach was undertaken to identify protein proﬁle changes between cancerous and normal breast tissues from 18 patients. Two protein extracts; aqueous soluble and membrane associated protein extracts were studied. Thirty four differentially expressed proteins were identiﬁed. The intensities of the proteins were used as variables in PCA and reduced data of six principal components (PC) were subjected to LDA in order to evaluate the potential of these proteins as collective biomarkers for breast cancer. The protein intensities of SEC13-like 1 (isoform b) and calreticulin contributed the most to the ﬁrst PC while the protein intensities of ﬁbrinogen beta chain precursor and ATP synthase D chain contributed the most to the second PC. Transthyretin precursor and apolipoprotein A-1 precursor contributed the most to the third PC. The results of LDA indicated good classiﬁcation of samples into normal and cancerous types when the ﬁrst 6 PCs were used as the variables. The percentage of correct classiﬁcation was 91.7\% for the originally grouped tissue samples and 88.9\% for cross-validated samples.},

	abstract = {The k-means algorithm is generally the most known and used clustering method. There are various extensions of k-means to be proposed in the literature. Although it is an unsupervised learning to clustering in pattern recognition and machine learning, the k-means algorithm and its extensions are always influenced by initializations with a necessary number of clusters a priori. That is, the k-means algorithm is not exactly an unsupervised clustering method. In this paper, we construct an unsupervised learning schema for the k-means algorithm so that it is free of initializations without parameter selection and can also simultaneously find an optimal number of clusters. That is, we propose a novel unsupervised k-means (U-k-means) clustering algorithm with automatically finding an optimal number of clusters without giving any initialization and parameter selection. The computational complexity of the proposed U-k-means clustering algorithm is also analyzed. Comparisons between the proposed U-k-means and other existing methods are made. Experimental results and comparisons actually demonstrate these good aspects of the proposed U-k-means clustering algorithm.},

The hybrid intelligent system aims to exploit the advantages of the constituent models and, at the same time, alleviate their limitations. It is able to learn incrementally from data samples (owing to Fuzzy Min–Max neural network), explain its predicted outputs (owing to the Classiﬁcation and Regression Tree), and achieve high classiﬁcation performances (owing to Random Forest). To evaluate the effectiveness of the hybrid intelligent system, three benchmark medical data sets, viz., Breast Cancer Wisconsin, Pima Indians Diabetes, and Liver Disorders from the UCI Repository of Machine Learning, are used for evaluation. A number of useful performance metrics in medical applications which include accuracy, sensitivity, speciﬁcity, as well as the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve are computed. The results are analyzed and compared with those from other methods published in the literature. The experimental outcomes positively demonstrate that the hybrid intelligent system is effective in undertaking medical data classiﬁcation tasks. More importantly, the hybrid intelligent system not only is able to produce good results but also to elucidate its knowledge base with a decision tree. As a result, domain users (i.e., medical practitioners) are able to comprehend the prediction given by the hybrid intelligent system; hence accepting its role as a useful medical decision support tool.},

Two datasets from UCI Machine Learning Repository, i.e., liver disorders dataset and Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnosis), are employed for benchmark test. Initially a case-based clustering method is applied to preprocess the dataset thus a more homogeneous data within each cluster will be attainted. A fuzzy decision tree is then applied to the data in each cluster and genetic algorithms (GAs) are further applied to construct a decision-making system based on the selected features and diseases identiﬁed. Finally, a set of fuzzy decision rules is generated for each cluster. As a result, the FDT model can accurately react to the test data by the inductions derived from the casebased fuzzy decision tree. The average forecasting accuracy for breast cancer of CBFDT model is 98.4\% and for liver disorders is 81.6\%. The accuracy of the hybrid model is the highest among those models compared. The hybrid model can produce accurate but also comprehensible decision rules that could potentially help medical doctors to extract effective conclusions in medical diagnosis.},

	abstract = {A challenge unique to classification model development is imbalanced data. In a binary classification problem, class imbalance occurs when one class, the minority group, contains significantly fewer samples than the other class, the majority group. In imbalanced data, the minority class is often the class of interest (e.g., patients with disease). However, when training a classifier on imbalanced data, the model will exhibit bias towards the majority class and, in extreme cases, may ignore the minority class completely. A common strategy for addressing class imbalance is data augmentation. However, traditional data augmentation methods are associated with overfitting, where the model is fit to the noise in the data. In this tutorial we introduce an advanced method for data augmentation: generative adversarial networks (GANs). The advantages of GANs over traditional data augmentation methods are illustrated using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin study. To promote the adoption of GANs for data augmentation, we present an end-to-end pipeline that encompasses the complete life cycle of a machine learning project along with alternatives and good practices both in the paper and in a separate video. Our code, data, full results and video tutorial are publicly available in the paper’s GitHub repository (https://github.com/yuxiaohuang/ research/tree/master/gwu/accepted/sam\_2021).},

	abstract = {In predictive modelling it is important to use any feature selection methods as irrelevant features when used with powerful classifiers can lead to over-fitting and thus create models which fail to perform as good as when these features are not used. Particularly it is important in case of disease datasets where various features or attributes are available through the patients’ medical records and many features in these datasets may not be relevant to the diagnosis of some specific disease. Wrong models in this case can be disastrous and lead to wrong diagnosis, and maybe in extreme cases lead to loss of life. To this end, we have used a wrapper based feature selection model for the said purpose. In recent years, Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm (GOA) has proved its superiority over other optimization algorithms in different research areas. In this paper, we propose an improved version of GOA, called (LAGOA), which uses Learning Automata (LA) for adjusting the parameters of GOA in an adaptive way, and two-phase mutation for enhancing exploitation capability of the algorithm. LA is used for adjusting the parameter values of each grasshopper in the population individually. In two-phase mutation the first phase reduces the number of selected features while preserving high classification accuracy, while the second phase adds relevant features which increase the classification accuracy. Proposed method has been applied to Breast Cancer (Wisconsin), Breast Cancer (Diagnosis), Statlog (Heart), Lung Cancer, SpectF Heart and Hepatitis datasets taken from UCI Machine Learning Repository. Experimental results confirm its superiority over state-of-the-art methods considered here for comparison.},

From the literature it has been found that different pattern recognition techniques can help them to improve in this domain. These techniques can help doctors form a second opinion and make a better diagnosis. In this paper we present a novel improvement in neural network training for pattern classiﬁcation. The proposed training algorithm is inspired by the biological metaplasticity property of neurons and Shannon’s information theory. During the training phase the Artiﬁcial metaplasticity Multilayer Perceptron (AMMLP) algorithm gives priority to updating the weights for the less frequent activations over the more frequent ones. In this way metaplasticity is modeled artiﬁcially. AMMLP achieves a more effcient training, while maintaining MLP performance. To test the proposed algorithm we used the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Database (WBCD). AMMLP performance is tested using classiﬁcation accuracy, sensitivity and speciﬁcity analysis, and confusion matrix. The obtained AMMLP classiﬁcation accuracy of 99.26\%, a very promising result compared to the Backpropagation Algorithm (BPA) and recent classiﬁcation techniques applied to the same database.},

	abstract = {Breast cancer affects many people at the present time. The factors that cause this disease are many and cannot be easily determined. Additionally, the diagnosis process which determines whether the cancer is benign or malignant also requires a great deal of effort from a doctors and physicians . When several tests are involved in the diagnosis of breast cancer, such as clump thickness, uniformity of cell size, uniformity of cell shape,…etc, the ultimate result may be difficult to obtain, even for medical experts. This has given a rise in the last few years to the use of machine learning and Artificial Intelligence in general as diagnostic tools. We aimed from this study to compare different classification learning algorithms significantly to predict a benign from malignant cancer in Wisconsin breast cancer dataset. We used the Wisconsin breast cancer dataset to compare five different learning algorithms , Bayesian Network, Naïve Bayes, Decision trees J4.8 , ADTree, and Multi-layer Neural Network along with t-test for the best algorithm in terms of prediction accuracy. The experiment, has shown that Bayesian Network is significantly better than the other algorithms.},

	abstract = {Breast Cancer is becoming a leading cause of death among women in the whole world; meanwhile, it is confirmed that the early detection and accurate diagnosis of this disease can ensure a long survival of the patients. This paper work presents a disease status prediction employing a hybrid methodology to forecast the changes and its consequence that is crucial for lethal infections. To alarm the severity of the diseases, our strategy consists of two main parts: 1. Information Treatment and Option Extraction, and 2. Decision Tree-Support Vector Machine (DT-SVM) Hybrid Model for predictions. We analyse the breast Cancer data available from the Wisconsin dataset from UCI machine learning with the aim of developing accurate prediction models for breast cancer using data mining techniques. In this experiment, we compare three classifications techniques in Weka software and comparison results show that DTSVM has higher prediction accuracy than Instance-based learning (IBL), Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO) and Naïve based classifiers.},

	abstract = {Breast cancer is one of the most leading causes of death among women. The early detection of abnormalities in breast enables the radiologist in diagnosing the breast cancer easily. Efficient tools in diagnosing the cancerous breast will help the medical experts in accurate diagnosis and timely treatment to the patients. In this work, experiments carried out using Wisconsin Diagnosis Breast Cancer database to classify the breast cancer either benign or malignant. Supervised learning algorithm Support Vector Machine (SVM) with kernels like Linear, Polynomial and Radial Basis Function and evolutionary algorithm Genetic Programming are used to train the models. The performance of the models are analysed where genetic programming approach provides more accuracy compared to Support Vector Machine in the classification of breast cancer and seems to be an fast and efficient method.},

	abstract = {White matter hyperintensities (WMHs) of presumed vascular origin are frequently observed in magnetic resonance images (MRIs) of the elderly. Detection and quantification of WMHs is important to help doctors make diagnoses and evaluate prognosis of their elderly patients, and once quantified, these can act as biomarkers in clinical research studies. Manual delineation of WMHs can be both time-consuming and inconsistent, hence, automatic segmentation methods are often preferred. However, fully automatic methods can be challenging to construct due to the variability in lesion load, placement of lesions, and voxel intensities. Several state-of-the-art lesion segmentation methods based on supervised Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been proposed. These approaches require manually delineated lesions for training the parameters of the network. Here we present a novel approach for WMH segmentation using a CNN trained in an unsupervised manner, by reconstructing multiple MRI sequences as weighted sums of segmentations of WMHs and tissues present in the images. After training, our method can be used to segment new images that are not part of the training set to provide fast and robust segmentation of WMHs in a matter of seconds per subject. Comparisons with state-of-theart WMH segmentation methods evaluated on ground truth manual labels from two distinct data sets and six different scanners indicate that the proposed method works well at generating accurate WMH segmentations without the need for manual delineations.},

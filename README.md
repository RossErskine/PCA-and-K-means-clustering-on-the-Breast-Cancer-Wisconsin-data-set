## Due date 
Deadline is Thu Jan 19th 2023 4pm (submissions allowed from Jan 12th onwards)

Each student must submit: 

    Paper (in PDF format). This file should be the same file for all members of a group. 
    Statement about own contribution to project (a couple of lines in TXT or Word format). Default would be hopefully something like "We all contributed equally". However, this individual statement can allow to provide markers with extra feedback/context if necessary, and will not be shared with other group members. (NB: this does not replace an ECs form.)


Optionally you can also submit:

    Code (any file format, try to make it only one file)
    Data (any file format, try to make it only one file)
